# Python_assignment2
 This assignment summarizes the exercises I completed to practice Python data structures, including lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. In the List Exercise, I began by creating a list of 5 random numbers and printed it to verify the values. I then updated the list by adding 3 new elements and printed the updated list to confirm the changes. Finally, I used a for loop to iterate over the list and printed each element individually, ensuring I understood list traversal. Moving on to the Dictionary Exercise, I created a dictionary with the keys name, age, and address, assigning them the values 'John', 25, and 'New York' respectively. I then added a new key-value pair, phone: '1234567890', to the dictionary and confirmed its addition by printing the updated dictionary. For the Set Exercise, I created a set containing the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. I added the value 6 to the set and verified its inclusion, followed by removing the value 3 and checking the set to confirm it had been updated correctly. Lastly, in the Tuple Exercise, I created a tuple with the values 1, 2, 3, and 4, and used the len() function to calculate and print the length of the tuple. These exercises helped me deepen my understanding of Python's core data structures and their operations, reinforcing my ability to work with them in real-world applications.
